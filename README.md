# Simple-Responsive-Web-Design
Projects from freeCodeCamp's responsive web design portion. These were done only to fulfill the user stories provided and are not the best in design or looking at all. Honestly they look terrible but they accomplish all user stories that are tested. Please do not copy the code for your own submission.
